# Quack

This Android app was created for the 2018 FBU program. It is a News App that attempts to decrease the impact of polarization in media by showing users articles from across the aisle while mitigating the abrasion caused by being exposed to drastically opposing viewpoints. The app also presents the news media graph in a more intuitive way, using a "honeycomb" view where honeycombs correspond to articles and the political affiliation of the articles, and honeycombs are surrounded by related articles.
